# cpds-dashboard

### Description

The cpds-dashboard is a user interaction component that provides web pages for the ContainerProblemDetectSystem (CPDS).

This component obtains the diagnosis result from the cpds-analyzer component(the Fault/Sub-Health Diagnosis component of CPDS) and displays the visual diagnosis results in real-time or offline. This helps the cluster O&M analyze the data, formulate and deliver policies.
